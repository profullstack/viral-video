[0-3s]
Yes… I made money while I was sleeping. Here’s the beginner-safe way people earn with crypto—without day trading.

[4-10s]
Crypto runs 24/7, so the trick is using systems that keep working while you rest. Three simple approaches: staking, yield, and long-term holding.

[11-25s] Staking
With staking, you lock coins to help secure a network and you earn rewards. Think Ethereum or Solana. Pick a trusted exchange or non-custodial validator. Rewards vary and prices still move, so start small and learn first.

[26-40s] Yield
Next is yield. Provide liquidity in DeFi or lend coins and you earn interest. Blue‑chip pools and audited protocols only. Watch fees and impermanent loss. If you can’t explain the risks, don’t deploy the funds.

[41-50s] Long-term holding
Finally, long‑term holding—buy strong projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana on a schedule and let time do the work. No late‑night chart chasing.

[51-58s] Wrap
Reminder: this is education, not financial advice. Always research and never risk money you can’t afford to lose.
